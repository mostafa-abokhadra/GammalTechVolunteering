ممكن تعمل كده ب استخدام tools زي google trends  عشان تلاقي فكره او تتاكد ان في مستخدمين بيبحثوا عن حاجه معينه

تقرا التقارير والوثائق اللي هتلاقيها عن الصناعه و المواقع الحكوميه اللي بتقدم احصائيات معينه

دايما لما تبدا بزنس جديد او حتى تضيف خدمه جديده على البزنس بتاعك انت لازم تعمل ال market research عشان تكون متاكد ان الخدمه اللي هتوفرها عليها الطلب والناس هتدفع عشانها 

افهم كويس المنتج اللي عايز تقدمه والخدمات اللي هتوفرها , اهم خصائصها وفوايدها و قيودها والقيمه اللي بتقدمها و تكلفتها

اقرا عن حالة السوق حاليا و قبل كده فالصناعه اللي انت عايز تضيف فيها واعرف ايه نقاط القوه و نقاط الضعف و الفرص الموجوده فالصناعه دي و التهديدات او العوائق اللي ممكن تقابلك

اعرف العملاء المحتملين و توزيعهم الجغرافي وليه وامتى وازاي عملائك ممكن يدفعوا للخدمه اللي هتقدمها وايه الحوافز او المعيقات اللي بتاثر ف قرارهم واتاكد ان الخدمه اللي هتقدمها الناس محتاجاها فعلا وهتقدملهم قيمه بجد 

اعرف ليه الناس بتشتري او مش بتشتري منك وايه اللي هما هيحبوا يشتروه منك بعد كده وايه الطريقه اللي هيحبوا يدفعوا بيها وليه وايه توقعاتهم لل خدمه اللي هتتقدم او منتظرين منك ايه وايه احتياجهم اللي انت ممكن توفره لهم و اللي هيضيفلهم قيمه جديده و عندهم استعداد يدفعوا قد ايه 

اعمل استطلاع لل خدمه اللي انت عايز تقدمها وخلي الفئه المستهدفه من الناس يملوا الاستطلاع ده 

حاولو تخلي الفئه المستهدفه تكون كبيره او اكتر من مجموعه

مثلا عملاء ب فئه عمريه معينه او ب اهتمامات معينه او ف مكان معين او تستهدف الاعمال الحكوميه او الاعمال نسها

لو اولريدي عندك البزنس اعمل استطلاعات اول ب اول على مدى رضا المستخدمين واقتراحاتهم وشكاويهم و مبيعاتك عامله ايه 

خطوه مهمه تانيه انك تدرس اخصامك 😂💚

لازم طبعا الخدمه اللي هتقدمها تكون مساويه او اعلى من اللي موجوده فالسوق او حاجه جديده خالص متعملتش
