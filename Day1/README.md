### Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is an advertising model in which a company compensates third-party publishers to generate traffic or leads to the company's products and services. The third-party publishers are affiliates, and the commission fee incentivizes them to find ways to promote the company.


Your website should offer valuable insights and encourage people to join Gammal Tech for a more comprehensive and professional experience.

For example, the value could lie in helping users discover their strengths by completing tasks and self-assessments, then inviting them to join Gammal Tech for professional mentorship through the volunteering phase.

Alternatively, the website could teach programming fundamentals, guiding users to join Gammal Tech to learn programming from scratch and become experts, as scattered information alone won't build true professional skills.

Programming skills are essential, but they’re not enough on their own to make a living. To succeed, you also need marketing and business skills. While you can create a website or mobile app, people are unlikely to use them if you don’t know how to reach and engage your audience effectively

Focus on the role that you believe suits you best and put in extra effort until you see results; whether that’s generating sales or not. If you achieve sales, continue in that role. If not, remember that what you enjoy may not always align with what’s most effective. Reevaluate your performance, as sometimes the best role is one that feels effortless. The ultimate measure is sales; the role that generates the most revenue is likely the best fit for you.
