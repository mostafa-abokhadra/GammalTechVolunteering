### UIUX

the website is about helping students who learn programming to work in real world projects with team mates so they can enhance their team work skills, strengthen their portfolio and CV and increasing their fellows network.

when ever a student wants to work on a project, he will upload a project post in the website saying for example that he wants to work on an e-commerce website that sells books and he want 2 backend developer and on UXUI designer, people can see this post and apply to work with him in the project, post owner then can accept or reject people request to join.

once the number of developers has been completed for a specific project, an email including the collaboration request in the project repo  will be sent to all team members , a group team chat will be generated automatically and the last 3 to 5 commits to the repo will be displayed in the website
