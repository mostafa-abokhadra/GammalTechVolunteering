**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of enhancing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). The primary goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic from search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. By optimizing a website’s structure, content, and technical aspects, SEO helps ensure that it ranks higher for relevant search queries, making it easier for users to find information, products, or services.

   - **URL Structure**: Keeping URLs short, descriptive, and keyword-rich.
   - **Internal Links**: Linking to other pages on your site to help users and search engines navigate your content.
