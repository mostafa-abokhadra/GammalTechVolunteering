### Day2

1. **Starting from day 2, you are going to implement the plan and update each task based on its progress:**
    - Move any task to 'In Progress' if you're actively working on it.
    - Move any task to 'In Issue' if thereâ€™s a problem you cannot resolve.
    - Move any task to 'Review' if the task is completed but no payments have been
    received.
    - Move any task to 'Done' once someone has paid after you finished the work.
2. **Join daily meetings with your volunteer friends in the WhatsApp group to share knowledge and support each other**.
